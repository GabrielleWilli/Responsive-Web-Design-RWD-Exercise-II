Overview

This project is a fully responsive, multi-page website designed to provide educational resources for parents. The goal was to ensure accessibility, ease of use, and a clean, modern design that works seamlessly across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

Approach

To create a user-friendly experience, I followed a mobile-first design approach with enhancing the layout for larger screens. The website structure is built with semantic HTML5 elements for clarity and accessibility, while CSS Flexbox and media queries ensure a responsive and flexible layout.

Key Features

Responsive Layout: Adapts to different screen sizes using media queries for mobile (≤480px), tablet (481px–768px), and desktop (≥769px).

Navigation Menu: Designed with Flexbox for easy alignment and a smooth user experience.

Responsive Images: Images automatically scale to fit different screen sizes while maintaining quality.

Smooth Transitions & Hover Effects: Enhances user interaction without breaking functionality.

Graceful Degradation: Ensures the core content remains accessible even on older browsers.

Challenges & Solutions

Ensuring full responsiveness – Required fine-tuning  to maintain a clean and readable layout across all devices.

Balancing aesthetics with performance – Used lightweight CSS enhancements like hover effects without compromising speed.

Cross-browser compatibility – Tested the design on different browsers to ensure a consistent experience.

Future Enhancements

Adding an FAQ section with collapsible content for better usability.

Further optimizing images for faster load times and improved performance.
